# RestAPI
It includes Frontends developed in Angular and React.
It includes Backends (RESTAPI) developed in Node.js and Java/Spring. You can use Mongo or MySQL as a database. You can also use Hibernate ORM (Spring) for Java/Spring RESTAPI.
     You need to set property to configure database in the config/config.js (Node.js) or WEB-INF/application.properties.

It is not clean or perfect code. There is a LOT to improve in the code and I leave up to you to do your best for this. It is just to display different way of coding for different things. ** Please note that it is not about fancy UI. It is about how things can be done in Angular, React, Node.js or Java/Spring. **

MORE COMING UP...HANG IN THERE...:)
